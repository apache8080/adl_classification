# adl_classification

Here is the code and data for a project on classifying user activity from wrist accelerometer (e.g.: fitbit) data.

The SUMMARY.md file has a write up with some explanations and final thoughts on this project.

## Note to instructors
All of the code for this project is in the cluster.py file. In order to run the file you will need python 3, numpy, scipy, matplotplib, and sklearn.
Make sure you run it using python3.
When you do python3 cluster.py it will run my final run function.
This function generates 5 different accuracies and confusion matrices that I used in my writeup for analysis.

The analysis/summary is in the SUMMARY.pdf/SUMMARY.md file. I recommend viewing the pdf file as it has the latex formatted.
